# Rust Worley noise implementation

This is a simple (and maybe a little unorthodox) implementation of Worley noise in Rust. You can specify the width, height and number of points you want to generate and the generated image will be saved as a PNG file in a folder called `img` (automatically created if it doesn't exist).
